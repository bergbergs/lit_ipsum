# Lit Ipsum
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/lit_ipsum.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/lit_ipsum)

## Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

gem 'lit_ipsum', :git=> 'https://github.com/bergbergs/lit_ipsum.git', :branch => 'master'
```

And then require the gem whereever you plan to use it.

```ruby
require 'lit_ipsum'

LitIpsum::Austen::PrideAndPrejudice.sentences(3) #=> "Other schemes, too, came into her head. As often as I can. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham."
LitIpsum::Austen::PrideAndPrejudice.words(7)     #=> "Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me."

LitIpsum::Doyle::SherlockHolmes.sentences(2)     #=> "And how in the world did you find them? It is half-past ten now."
LitIpsum::Doyle::SherlockHolmes.words(5)         #=> "Yes, it did. Get out!"
